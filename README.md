# Learning about Version Control
In general i find version control useful when working in large teams. This past summer, I had the opportunity to work with SaveOnFoods, where I was tasked with migrating the entirety of their code base over to github. 
Throughout the project, the most consistent frustrations where those surrounding different branches, and scenerious where the client was still updating their files even though the github was operational.
In general, I think the lack of understanding surrounding version control is the most frustrating part. Also, at the end of the day version control is an organization tool - and organization is rarely interesting or fufilling.
